_The National Park System, of which Petrified Forest National Monument
is a unit, is dedicated to the conservation of America’s scenic,
scientific, and historic heritage for the benefit and enjoyment of the
people._

Petrified Forest National Monument, containing 85,304 acres of federally
owned land, has the greatest and most colorful concentration of
petrified wood known in the world. In the monument are six separate
“forests” where giant logs of agatized wood lie prostrate, surrounded by
numerous broken sections and smaller chips and fragments.

The area is a part of the Painted Desert of northern Arizona, a region
of banded rocks of many hues carved by wind and rain into a fantastic
landscape. Here and there beds of shale contain perfectly preserved
fossil leaves of plants of a remote age. Occasionally the bones of giant
reptiles and amphibians are washed from their burial places in the
deposits.


            _PREHISTORIC INDIANS LIVED IN PETRIFIED FOREST_

The ruins of pueblos built by Indians in pre-Columbian times, from 800
to 1,400 years ago, are scattered on nearly every mesa throughout the
monument. Low mounds, strewn with blocks of sandstone and bits of broken
pottery, mark the sites of these ancient homes. Some of the dwellings,
such as the Agate House in the Third Forest, were built of blocks of
petrified wood, and smaller fragments of this material were chipped into
arrowheads, knives, and scrapers. Many petroglyphs (pictures carved into
the surface of the rock) are found on the sandstone rocks throughout the
area.


                               _HISTORY_

Apparently the first man to report the “stone trees” was Lieutenant
Sitgreaves, an Army officer who explored parts of northern Arizona in
1851, soon after Arizona was acquired by the United States.

The petrified forests remained largely unknown, however, until the
settlement of northern Arizona began in 1878 and the Atlantic and
Pacific, now the Santa Fe Railway, was completed across northern Arizona
in 1883. During the following years, the existence of the petrified
forests was threatened by souvenir hunters, gem collectors, commercial
jewelers, and abrasive manufacturers. Entire logs were blasted to obtain
the quartz and amethyst crystals often found within the logs, and much
agate was carried away for making jewelry. The erection of a stamp mill
near the forests to crush the petrified logs into abrasives offered the
most serious threat. Alarmed, the citizens of Arizona, through their
territorial legislature, petitioned Congress to make the area a national
reserve “so that future generations might enjoy its beauties, and study
one of the most curious results of nature’s forces.”

Following an investigation by Lester F. Ward, of the United States
Geological Survey, Petrified Forest National Monument was established by
President Theodore Roosevelt on December 8, 1906, under authority of the
Act for the Preservation of American Antiquities.


                          _THE GEOLOGIC STORY_

_The Forests._—About 160 million years ago, in Triassic time, northern
Arizona was probably a lowland where shifting streams spread sand and
mud over the plains. Scientists believe that the growing forests were
upstream, possibly as much as a hundred miles west and southwest of the
present petrified forests. The principal tree resembled modern pines,
but was more closely related to the Araucarian pines of South America
and Australia. Remains of two other kinds of primitive trees are also
occasionally found.

_The Trees Were Buried._—Natural processes, sometimes hastened by
destructive fires and ravages of insects, are believed to have killed
the trees. Certainly, many of them decayed on the ground, but others
fell into streams and came to rest in bays or on sand bars where rapid
burial by mud and sand prevented their decay. The deposits in which
these trees were buried eventually turned to the hard sandstones and
shales now called the Chinle formation. These were buried at least 3,000
feet beneath layers of sand and silt spread by shallow seas.

_The Logs Petrified._—The sediments in which the logs were buried
contained a large amount of volcanic ash, high in the mineral silica.
This silica was picked up by ground water, carried into the wood, and
deposited in the cell tissue. The mineral filled the wood solidly,
forming the present petrified log. However, the greater part of the
original cellulose remains. The various color patterns were caused by
oxides of iron and manganese. This particular type is known as agatized
wood. Cavities in the logs were often filled or lined with quartz
crystals.

_How the Forest Was Brought to Light._—Since the forest was buried there
have been several periods of great mountain making. Forces from deep in
the earth thrust the Rockies and Sierras upward several thousand feet,
and the land between was lifted far above its former position near sea
level. As a result of this great mountain growth, certain areas became
arid and desertlike; soon wind and rain started wearing down the great
deposits that covered this region. Large river systems carried away the
loose mud, sand, and gravel which finally found its way to the sea. Thus
the sediments that once covered the forest were removed. Finally the
layers in which the logs were buried were cut by canyons and ravines,
revealing the great petrified logs and the many bands of colored rock
that make up the Painted Desert. It is believed that the petrified logs
were cracked in many places by the weight of sediments and earthquakes
during the mountain uplift period. As the logs wash from the hillsides,
they break into sections which accumulate in piles at the base of the
cliffs. Only a small portion of the petrified forests is now exposed,
for logs occur below the surface of the ground to a depth of about 300
feet.

_Broken Log Sections._—Rhythmic vibrations of earthquakes during the
period of uplift of the land are believed to have produced fine cracks
at more or less regular intervals across the petrified logs. As erosion
of the softer material around the logs took place at the surface of the
land, the exposed cracks widened, separating the logs into sections.

_The Painted Desert._—The badlands of the Petrified Forest areas and the
Painted Desert get their color from the ancient volcanic deposits of
that region, and the surface forms are typical of desert erosion.

The material from which the badlands were sculptured originally was
deposited layer upon layer as volcanic ash. The decomposition of the ash
which released silica for petrification converted the ash into claylike
rock, called bentonite. When pure, the bentonite is nearly white, but in
the Painted Desert it is stained all shades of red, orange, maroon,
blue, purple, and yellow by iron minerals that also came from volcanic
ash.

    [Illustration: _Interesting Formations in the Third Forest._]

Bentonitic beds in arid or semiarid regions erode into badlands. The
bentonite absorbs water like a sponge, swells, and disintegrates into a
fine mud. As a result, the torrential summer rains that fall in northern
Arizona rapidly cut the banded, bentonitic beds into sharp, conical
hills, turreted ridges, and sharp, interbranching canyons and ravines.
When dry, the bentonite is hard and strong, thus preserving these
intricate badlands forms during the long periods between rains. Locally,
a hard sandstone caprock may prevent rapid erosion of the shales beneath
to form an abrupt-sided, table-topped butte or mesa. The resistant
capping of the rim of the Painted Desert is composed of ancient volcanic
rock.


                         _INTERPRETIVE SERVICE_

All visitors are invited to see the Rainbow Forest Museum. Its exhibits
include many outstanding examples of polished petrified wood, fossils,
and minerals; charts explaining the formation of the petrified forests
and the badlands; and a diorama. Other exhibits may be seen at the
Painted Desert Museum, which is open during the summer.

During the summer months short talks are given periodically in the
Rainbow Forest Museum; and, as circumstances permit, guided tours
through the Rainbow Forest are conducted by park ranger naturalists.

All of these services are free of charge.


                          _TRAVEL INFORMATION_

Excellent paved approach roads make Petrified Forest National Monument
easily accessible by car, and it can be visited throughout the year. US
66, crossing the area near the Painted Desert, is the approach from the
east. Travelers from the southeast, south, and west enter from US 260.
The monument road connects these two main highways and leads through the
more interesting parts of the area. This road through the monument is
closed to through travel at night.

Travelers by rail must obtain privately operated cars in Gallup, N.
Mex., and Holbrook and Winslow, Ariz., for tours through the monument as
no scheduled tours are available.


                     _ACCOMMODATIONS AND SUPPLIES_

At the Rainbow Forest, a small picnic ground, equipped with table,
shade, and water supply, is available for free use in daytime only.
There are no camping facilities.

_Please help to maintain and protect Petrified Forest National Monument
by refraining from destroying or removing specimens of petrified wood
(no matter how small the piece) or defacing or marking ruins,
pictographs, petroglyphs, or other works of prehistoric man. If each of
the hundreds of thousands of yearly visitors took pieces of petrified
wood, there would soon be none left. Once removed, it is gone forever—it
cannot be replaced._

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
